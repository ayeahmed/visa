# Problem Statement
Problem Statement: Working and understanding legal documents, such as Visa documenration, can be challenging even to digest due to their dense nature. For nonnative English speakers, this difficulty is magnified, and makes the process even more challenging.Ahmed
# Project Objective
Our solution is to develop and design a website to summarize legal documents and deliver information catered to an individuals converns. We firstly prompt the user to enter their language of choice, and the rest of the website will run in this languaged. A client can then enter their Visa status and a summary of what kind of information they are looking for, alongside the documents they wish to obtain this information from. The website will take the legal documentation, find the important information corresponding to the client's concerns, and summarize it back to the client in their native language.
