# Problem Statement
Legal documentation can often be difficult to comprehend for the average English speaker due to the dense nature of the material. For nonnative English speakers, this difficulty is magnified, and makes the legal process of applying for Visas and understanding one's situation even more challenging.
# Project Objective
Our solution is to develop and design a website to summarize legal documents and deliver information catered to an individual's concerns in the client's preferred language. We firstly prompt the user to enter their language of choice. A client can then enter their Visa status and a summary of what kind of information they are looking for, alongside the documents they wish to obtain this information from. The website will take the legal documentation, find the important information corresponding to the client's concerns, and summarize it back to the client in their native language.
